- Completly OOP
- RainTPL templates for Views
- Models and Controllers (MVC) but you can code whatever presentation pattern you want
- Post processor (in progress)
- backend admin zone
- really simple
- ugly demo at http://tao.homeunix.net/yacms/
- widget support and multiple skins 
- code first approach to database, using Doctrine, YAML definition for models and some scripts to regenerate the datbase
- Can be used with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc .. via Doctrine

I have a post about code first approach in my blog, using Doctrine and Composer. you can read it here.
